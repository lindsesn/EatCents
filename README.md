Based on the information from Yelp, our program creates an interactive map with color-coded dots that shows the users the most affordable restaurants in their city.

The program takes the user's city of choice from the input from the console. Then, up to 50 restaurants from the inputted city that have $ or $$ as their price level. Then, the user is taken to a website with a map with the restaurants shown as pinpoints (dots). When the user hovers over a dot, it shows the tab with the name of the restaurant and price level.

One $ priced restaurants are represented by the blue dots. Two ($$) priced restaurants are represented by the pink dots.

NOTE: to test the project, you must install the requests and plotly libraries . You can try running the following commands in the terminal on macOS, Windows, and Linux: python -m pip install -U matplotlib, pip install plotly==5.22.0, or pip install matplotlib.
